In his youth he became a senior [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] officer in the colonial militia during the first stages of the [[French and Indian War]]. In 1775, the [[Second Continental Congress]] commissioned Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution. In that command, Washington [[Siege of Boston|forced the British out of Boston]] in 1776, but was defeated and nearly captured later that year when he [[New York and New Jersey campaigns#New York campaign|lost New York City]]. After [[Washington's crossing of the Delaware River|crossing the Delaware River]] in the middle of winter, he [[Battle of Trenton|defeated the British]] in two battles, retook New Jersey and restored momentum to the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause. This is known as the [[Battle of Trenton]].\r\n\r\nHis strategy enabled Continental forces to capture two major British armies at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga in 1777]] and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown in 1781]]. Historians laud Washington for the selection and supervision of his generals, preservation and command of the army, coordination with the Congress, with state governors and their militia, and attention to supplies, logistics, and training. In battle, however, Washington was repeatedly outmaneuvered by British generals with larger armies. After victory had been finalized in 1783, Washington resigned as commander-in-chief rather than seize power, proving his opposition to dictatorship and his commitment to [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Unger|2013|p=18}}<\/ref>\r\n\r\nWashington presided over the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention in 1787]], which devised a new form of [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] for the United States. Following unanimous election as President in [[United States presidential election, 1788\u20131789|1789]], he worked to unify rival factions in the fledgling nation. He supported [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s programs to satisfy all debts, federal and state, established a permanent seat of government, implemented an effective tax system, and created a national bank.<ref name=\"Unger236\">{{harvtxt|Unger|2013|p=236}}<\/ref> In avoiding war with Great Britain, he guaranteed a decade of peace and profitable trade by securing the [[Jay Treaty]] in 1795, despite intense opposition from the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonians]]. Although he remained nonpartisan, never joining the [[Federalist Party]], he largely supported their policies. [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] was an influential primer on [[Civic virtue|republican virtue]], warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars. He retired from the presidency in 1797, returning to his home and plantation at [[Mount Vernon]].\r\n\r\nWhile in power, his use of national authority pursued many ends, especially the preservation of liberty, reduction of regional tensions, and promotion of a spirit of American nationalism.<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Cayton|title=Learning to Be Washington|url=http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/10\/03\/books\/review\/Cayton-t.html?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=September 30, 2010}}<\/ref> Upon his death, Washington was [[eulogy|eulogized]] as \"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\" by [[Henry Lee III|Henry Lee]].<ref>{{harvtxt|O'Brien|2009|p=19}}<\/ref> Revered in life and in death, scholarly and public polling [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|consistently ranks]] him among the top three presidents in American history; he has been [[Cultural depictions of George Washington|depicted]] and [[List of monuments dedicated to George Washington|remembered]] in monuments, currency, and other dedications to the present day.\r\n\r\n==Early life (1732\u20131753)==\r\n{{Further|Ancestry of George Washington}}\r\n[[File:George Washington's birthplace (1856 engraving).jpg|thumb|left|Washington's birthplace]]\r\nThe first child of [[Augustine Washington]] (1694\u20131743) and his second wife, [[Mary Ball Washington]] (1708\u20131789), George Washington was born on their [[George Washington Birthplace National Monument|Pope's Creek Estate]] near present-day [[Colonial Beach, Virginia|Colonial Beach]] in [[Westmoreland County, Virginia]].

Thanks also to Lawrence's involvement in the [[Ohio Company]], a land investment company funded by Virginia investors, and Lawrence's position as commander of the Virginia militia, Washington came to the notice of the new lieutenant governor of Virginia, [[Robert Dinwiddie]].

These competing claims led to a war in the colonies called the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201362), and contributed to the start of the global [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u201363). By chance, Washington became involved in its beginning.\r\n\r\n[[Robert Dinwiddie]], [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|lieutenant governor of colonial Virginia]], was ordered by the British government to guard the British territorial claims including the [[Ohio River]] basin. In late 1753 Dinwiddie ordered Washington to deliver a letter asking the French to vacate the [[Ohio Valley]];<ref name=autogenerated1 \/> he was eager to prove himself as the new adjutant general of the militia, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor himself only a year before.

However, before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of [[Fort Duquesne]]. A small detachment of French troops led by [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville]], was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]]. On May 28, 1754 Washington and some of his militia unit, aided by their [[Mingo]] allies, ambushed the French in what has come to be called the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]]. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. Whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with Washington or by another means, is not completely clear.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lengel|2005|pp=31\u201338}}<\/ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Anderson|2000|pp=53\u201358}}<\/ref>  He was given the epithet [[Town Destroyer]] by Tanacharison.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul R.

This was the largest British expedition to the colonies, and was intended to expel the French from the Ohio Country; the first objective was the capture of [[Fort Duquesne]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Alden|1993|pp=35\u201336}}<\/ref> Washington initially sought from Braddock an appointment as a major, but upon advice that no rank above captain could be given except by London, he agreed to serve as a staff volunteer. During the passage of the expedition, Washington fell ill with severe headaches and fever; nevertheless, when the pace of the troops continued to slow, Washington recommended to Braddock that the army be split into two divisions \u2013 a primary and more lightly, but adequately equipped, \"flying column\" offensive which could move at a more rapid pace, to be followed by a more heavily armed reinforcing division. Braddock accepted the recommendation (likely made in a [[council of war]] including other officers) and took command of the lead division.<ref>{{harvtxt|Alden|1993|p=37}}<\/ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Ferling|2010|pp=35\u201336}}<\/ref>\r\n\r\nIn the [[Battle of the Monongahela]] the French and their Indian allies ambushed Braddock's reduced forces and the general was mortally wounded. After suffering devastating casualties, the British panicked and retreated in disarray; however, Washington rode back and forth across the battlefield, rallying the remnants of the British and Virginian forces into an organized retreat. In the process, despite his lingering illness, he demonstrated much bravery and stamina\u2014he had two horses shot from underneath him, while his coat was pierced with four bullets. In his report, Washington chiefly blamed the disaster on the conduct of the redcoats while praising that of the Virginia contingent. Whatever responsibility rested on him for the defeat as a result of his recommendation to Braddock, Washington was not included by the succeeding commander, Col. Thomas Dunbar, in planning subsequent force movements.<ref>{{harvtxt|Alden|1993|pp=37\u201346}}<\/ref>\r\n\r\n===Commander of Virginia Regiment===\r\nLt. Governor Dinwiddie rewarded Washington in 1755 with a commission as \"Colonel of the Virginia Regiment and Commander in Chief of all forces now raised in the defense of His Majesty's Colony\" and gave him the task of defending Virginia's frontier. The Virginia Regiment was the first full-time American military unit in the colonies (as opposed to part-time militias and the British regular units). Washington was ordered to \"act defensively or offensively\" as he thought best.<ref>{{harvtxt|Flexner|1965|p=138}}<\/ref> While Washington happily accepted the commission, the coveted redcoat of a British officer as well as the accompanying pay continued to elude him.

First, in 1775\u201377, and again in 1781 he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces. Although he lost many of his battles, he never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.

The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites (like [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]) never mastered the art of command.<ref name=\"ch3\"\/>\r\n\r\nEventually, he found capable officers, such as General [[Nathanael Greene]], General [[Daniel Morgan]] - \"the old wagoner\" that he had served with in [[The French and Indian War]], [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Henry Knox]] - chief of artillery, and [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] - chief-of-staff. The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and consequently they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes, at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777) and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781), came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref name=\"ch3\"\/> [[Daniel Morgan]]'s annihilation of [[Banastre Tarleton]]'s legion of dragoons at [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]] in February 1781, came as a result of Morgan's employment of superior line tactics against his British opponent, resulting in one of the very few double envelopments in military history, another being [[Hannibal]]'s defeat of the Romans at [[Cannae]] in 216 b.c. The decisive defeat of Col. [[Patrick Ferguson]]'s Tory Regiment at [[King's Mountain]] demonstrated the superiority of the riflery of American \"over mountain men\" over British-trained troops armed with musket and bayonet. These \"over-mountain men\" were led by a variety of elected officers, including the 6'6\" [[William Campbell (general)|William Campbell]] who had become one of Washington's officers by the time of Yorktown. Similarly, Morgan's Virginia riflemen proved themselves superior to the British at Saratoga, a post-revolutionary war development being the creation of trained \"rifle battalions\" in the European armies.\r\n\r\nWashington's third, and most important role in the war effort, was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown\u2014the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won (rather than declaring himself monarch), he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs. Yet his constant reiteration of the point that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as erratic militias (clearly demonstrated in the rout at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], where only the Maryland and Delaware Continentals under [[Baron DeKalb]] held firm), helped overcome the ideological distrust of a standing army.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jensen |first=Richard |url=http:\/\/tigger.uic.edu\/~rjensen\/am-rev.htm |title=Military History of the American Revolution |work=Jensen's Web Guides|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago|date=February 12, 2002 |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}<\/ref>\r\n\r\n===Victory at Boston===\r\n[[File:GeorgeWashington1775.jpg|thumb|Washington taking Control of the Continental Army, 1775]]\r\n\r\nWashington assumed command of the Continental Army in the field at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in July 1775, during the ongoing [[siege of Boston]].

Meanwhile, Washington rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe, while closely following the action in upstate New York, where the patriots were led by General [[Philip Schuyler]] and his successor [[Horatio Gates]]. The ensuing pitched battles at Philadelphia were too complex for Washington's relatively inexperienced men and they were defeated. At the [[Battle of Brandywine]] on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington, and marched into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26. Washington's army [[Battle of Germantown|unsuccessfully attacked]] the British garrison at [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]] in early October.

Jefferson's political actions, his support of [[Philip Freneau]]'s ''[[National Gazette]]'',<ref>{{harvtxt|Elkins|McKitrick|1995|pp=240, 285, 290, 361}}<\/ref> and his attempt to undermine Hamilton, nearly led George Washington to dismiss Jefferson from his cabinet.<ref name=\"ChernowRon\">{{cite book|last=Chernow|first=Ron|title=Alexander Hamilton|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=1-59420-009-2|authorlink=Ron Chernow|page=427}}<\/ref> Though Jefferson left the cabinet voluntarily, Washington never forgave him, and never spoke to him again.<ref name=\"ChernowRon\" \/>\r\n\r\nIn early 1790 Hamilton devised a plan with the approval of Washington, culminating in The [[Residence Act|Residence Act of 1790]], that established the creditworthiness of the new government, as well as its permanent location. Congress had previously issued almost $22 million in certificates of debt during the war to suppliers; some of the states had incurred debt as well (more so in the north). In accordance with the plan, Congress authorized the \"assumption\" and payment of these debts, and provided funding through customs duties and excise taxes. The proposal was largely favored in the north and opposed in the south. Hamilton obtained the approval of the southern states in exchange for an agreement to place the new national capitol on the Potomac River. While the national debt increased as a result during Hamilton's service as Secretary of the Treasury, the nation established its good credit. Many in the Congress and elsewhere in the government profited from trading in the debt paper which was assumed. Though many of Washington's fellow Virginians, as well as others, were vexed by this, he considered they had adequate redress through their Congressional representatives.<ref>{{harvtxt|Alden|1993|pp=243\u2013244}}<\/ref>\r\n\r\nThe Revenue Act authorized the President to select the specific location of the seat of the government on the Potomac; the President was to appoint three commissioners to survey and acquire property for this seat.

In 1791, the commissioners named the permanent seat of government \"The City of Washington in the Territory of Columbia\" to honor Washington.

The wealthy widow Martha brought at least 85 \"[[dower]] slaves\" to Mount Vernon by inheriting a third of her late husband's estate. Using his wife's great wealth, Washington bought more land, tripling the size of the plantation at Mount Vernon, and purchased the additional slaves needed to work it.

Numerous historians have suggested that theologically, Washington agreed largely with the Deists. However, he never made a statement one way or the other. He often used words for the deity, such as \"God\" and \"Providence,\"  while avoiding using the words \"Jesus\" and \"Christ.\" In his collected works, they appear in an official letter to Indians that might have been drafted by an aide. At the time, [[Deism]] was a theological outlook, not an organized denomination, and was compatible with being an Episcopalian. Historian Gregg Frazer argues that Washington was not a deist but a \"theistic rationalist.\"  This theological position rejected core beliefs of Christianity, such as the divinity of Christ, the Trinity and original sin.  However, unlike the deists, the theological rationalists believed in the [[efficacy of prayer]] to God.<ref>Gregg L. Frazer, ''The Religious Beliefs of America's Founders: Reason, Revelation, and Revolution'' (University Press of Kansas, 2012)<\/ref> Historian Peter A.

Before the Revolutionary War he was Anglican\u2014Church of England\u2014which meant after the war, he was Episcopalian. So, he was clearly Christian ... He was quite intensely religious, because even though he uses the word Providence, he constantly sees Providence as an active force in life, particularly in American life. I mean, every single victory in war he credits to Providence. The miracle of the Constitutional Convention he credits to Providence. The creation of the federal government and the prosperity of the early republic, he credits to Providence ... I was struck at how frequently in his letters he's referring to Providence, and it's Providence where there's a sense of design and purpose, which sounds to me very much like religion ...
